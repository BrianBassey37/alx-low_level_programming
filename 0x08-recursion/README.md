 **0. She locked away a secret, deep inside herself, something she once knew to be true... but chose to forget**
  * [0-puts_recursion.c](./0-puts_recursion.c): C function that prints a string,
  followed by a new line.

* **1. Why is it so important to dream? Because, in my dreams we are together**
  * [1-print_rev_recursion.c](./1-print_rev_recursion.c): C function that prints
  a string in reverse.

* **2. Dreams feel real while we're in them. It's only when we wake up that we realize something was actually strange**
  * [2-strlen_recursion.c](./2-strlen_recursion.c): C function that returns the
  length of a string.

* **3. You mustn't be afraid to dream a little bigger, darling**
  * [3-factorial.c](./3-factorial.c): C function that returns the factorial of
  a given number.

* **4. Once an idea has taken hold of the brain it's almost impossible to eradicate**
  * [4-pow_recursion.c](./4-pow_recursion.c): C function that returns the value of
  a number `x` raised to the value of an input `y`.
    * If `y` is less than `0`, the function returns `-1`.

* **5. Your subconscious is looking for the dreamer**
  * [5-sqrt_recursion.c](./5-sqrt_recursion.c): C function that returns the natural square
  root of a number.
    * If the number does not have a natural square root, the function returns `-1`.

* **6. Inception. Is it possible?**
  * [6-is_prime_number.c](./6-is_prime_number.c): C function that checks in an
  integer is a prime number.
    * If the integer is prime, the function returns `1`.
    * Otherwise, the function returns `0`.

* **7. They say we only use a fraction of our brain's true potential. Now that's when we're awake. When we're asleep, we can do almost anything**
  * [7-is_palindrome.c](./7-is_palindrome.c): C function that checks if a string is
  a palindrome.
    * If the string is a palindrome, the function returns `1`.
    * Otherwise, the function returns `0`.

* **8. Inception. Now, before you bother telling me it's impossible...**
  * [100-wildcmp.c](./100-wildcmp.c): C function that compares two strings
  `s1` and `s2`.
    * `s2` can contain the special character `*`.
    * If the strings can be considered identical, the function returns `1`. Otherwise, the function returns `0`
